# odin-landing-page

Project Complete - 

All lessons on flexbox leading to this project helped prepare me well. I found it easy to work with and didn't need to look for help on structure to get to the end result.

I laid out a basic structure on paper, before then creating the html to follow it. I then styled the content from top to bottom on the landing page. My initial structure proved successful and didn't require any major changes.

Some elements are responsive and flex nicely with viewport changes. However as this was specifically noted to be out of scope, I did not ensure that all elements were responsive, and currently don't know the most effective way to do this.


Odin Project Brief:

For this project you’ll be creating an entire web page from a design we’ll provide for you.
If you’ve been following along you should have the skills you need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!

The design we’re providing you comes in the form of 2 images:
one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used.
